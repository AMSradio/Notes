# WORKFLOW of Assignments, Howemwork, and Lectures
## ASSIGNMENT REPO, AND PUSH TO GIT HUB
    Copy revisions in myfork (right click copy/paste on left workspace)
    paste it into your assignment repo created for each module (example PyPoll_Module_3)
    You will commit and push your official turn ins from here to your GIT HUB repo (that has been linked)
    You will still need to copy link from Git Hub repo to paste into Canvas to turn in work
## MYFORK
    This is basically your holding space to keep files you are working on while new cirriculum is published
    Having this holding space will allow you to continue to work on things without overriding with new pulls
    this is a good place to save and backup your work before final submission
    we added an additional remote connection from the main curriculum repo (master) so that pulling can be done into this folder as well. that way when merge conflicts do happen, you can pick and choose which edited versions you want to keep (yours or the pull)
## Curriculum
    This is where the "official" assignments, communications, and lecture notes are published
    Changes are frequent (or at least that is implied) so you will be pulling here and syncing often
