# REMEMBER THIS!!!
    response.url
    this will bring back the API url that you can plug into your chrome extension
    you have to remove the .json part to do it

    response.json()
    will print it in a json like way in your cell

    json.dumps() google it. it will let you space out the information a little bit to make it easier to read

    From pprint import pprint
    then use: pprint(response)
    ^^ google that too

# GIVE YOUR RESULTS PATH A VARIABLE
    response = results
